8. Find the information about the order of initialization, when you create a new object of a class:
When constructors, initialization blocks are being executed.
When fields are initialized with default values.

When constructors, initialization blocks are being executed.

Order of execution:
1. static initialization blocks of super classes
2. static initialization blocks of the class
3. instance initialization blocks of super classes
4. constructors of super classes
5. instance initialization blocks of the class
6. constructor of the class

The code in static initialization block will be executed at class load time - once per class load, before any instances
of the class are constructed and before any static methods are called.

The instance initialization block is actually copied by the Java compiler into every constructor the class has.
So every time the code in instance initialization block is executed exactly before the code in constructor.




When fields are initialized with default values

4.12.5. Initial Values of Variables
Every variable in a program must have a value before its value is used:
Each class variable, instance variable, or array component is initialized with a default value when it is created (ยง15.9, ยง15.10.2)
